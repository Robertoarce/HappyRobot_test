# Inbound Carrier Sales Automation — Build Description

**Prepared for:** HappyRobot Logistics — IT & Business review
**Engagement:** FDE proof-of-concept — automate the inbound carrier desk
**Status:** Working end-to-end, validated with live calls against real systems

---

## 1. Executive summary

We built an AI voice agent that answers inbound carrier calls and runs the full
first-leg conversation a dispatcher would: it verifies the carrier's license,
confirms their identity, finds a matching load, negotiates the rate, books it,
and hands off to a senior rep — with every call automatically logged and
measured.

The solution is in production-grade shape: the integration service is deployed
to the cloud, the workflow runs on the HappyRobot platform, every call is logged
to a live Twin database, and we have completed full live bookings against the
real FMCSA registry and the legacy TMS. One infra item — outbound SMS sending —
is gated behind workspace Admin permissions on the trial org; it is fully built
and documented as a one-step production activation (the OTP itself works; the
code is read from the run log for the POC).

## 2. Architecture

Three layers, one of which we built:

```
   Carrier (browser-based "web call")
            │  voice
            ▼
   HappyRobot platform  ──────────  voice agent, workflow logic, OTP step,
   (no-code, configured)            post-call analytics, dashboard
            │  HTTPS webhooks (JSON), X-API-Key auth
            ▼
   Carrier Sales Middleware  ─────  Python/FastAPI, Dockerized, on Railway
   (the integration layer)          translates web → legacy + external APIs
        │                    │
        ▼                    ▼
   FMCSA QCMobile API    Legacy TMS (raw TCP, fixed-width protocol)
```

**Why the middleware exists.** The legacy TMS speaks a raw, fixed-width TCP
line protocol (AS/400-style) — no REST, no JSON — and deliberately injects faults
(timeouts, truncated/garbled responses). The HappyRobot platform cannot speak
that protocol. The middleware is a small translator: clean REST/JSON to the
platform on one side, the legacy protocol (and the FMCSA API) on the other.

## 3. Call flow

```
Carrier calls (web) → greet, collect MC number → read back digits to confirm
  → verify_carrier (FMCSA) ──not eligible──► end call (one MC per call)
  → eligible → request_otp → SMS code* → carrier reads it back
  → verify_otp ──fail x3 / expired──► end call
  → verified → collect lane + equipment → search_loads
  → no match → offer other lanes / end
  → pitch one load (route, dates, miles, listed rate — ceiling never disclosed)
  → negotiate: evaluate_negotiation per round (max 3, hold the line)
  → agree → book_load → booking reference
  → mocked senior-rep handoff
  → post-call: AI extraction + classification → analytics
```
\*SMS delivery is built but requires a provisioned sender (see §9).

---

## 4. Key design decisions

**Fault-tolerant TMS adapter.** One TCP connection per request (per spec), reads
until the `END` terminator (defeats the "delayed close" fault), and retries
transport faults (timeout, truncation, malformed frames) with exponential
backoff — but never retries semantic errors like `ALREADY_BOOKED` (which would
double-book). The real wire format differed from the docs (short load IDs,
unpadded numbers); the parser handles both.

**Rate ceiling never leaves the server.** The hidden maximum (`max_buy`) is used
only inside the middleware's negotiation logic. The voice agent sends "carrier
wants $X, round N" and receives only "accept / counter at $Y / reject." The
language model never has the ceiling in its context, so it cannot leak it under
any prompt or social-engineering pressure.

**OTP isolated from the agent, bound to the registered number.** The 6-digit
code is generated server-side (5-minute expiry, 3 attempts) and is never placed
in the agent's conversational context — so the agent has no code to be talked
into revealing. The code is also bound to the carrier's **FMCSA-registered
telephone** (surfaced by `verify_carrier`, threaded into `/otp/request`) rather
than a number the caller states on the line — so a caller cannot have the code
redirected to their own phone. Only a masked form ("ending in 1234") is ever
exposed to the agent; the full number and code go solely to the SMS node.

**Negotiation policy.** Server-side, capped at 3 counter rounds; the agent must
obtain a specific dollar figure from the carrier before evaluating, never
volunteers increases, and closes professionally with no transfer if no deal.

**One verification attempt per call.** After a confirmed MC fails FMCSA, the call
ends — preventing MC "fishing" (trying numbers until one is valid). This was
hardened in response to an adversarial finding (see §8).

## 5. Middleware endpoints

| Method · Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /healthz` | Liveness |
| `GET /tms/ping` | TMS connectivity (DEBUG_ECHO) |
| `POST /carriers/verify` | FMCSA authority check by MC number |
| `POST /otp/request` · `/otp/verify` | OTP issue / verify |
| `POST /loads/search` | TMS load search |
| `GET /loads/{id}` | Load detail |
| `POST /loads/{id}/book` | Book a load |
| `POST /negotiate/evaluate` | accept / counter / reject (ceiling stays server-side) |

All endpoints require an `X-API-Key` header.

---

## 6. Data layer & operational dashboard

Per-call data is captured natively as **run variables** produced by post-call
AI nodes — `outcome` and `sentiment` (AI Classify), `negotiation_rounds` and
`opening_ask` (AI Extract), plus computed `computed_margin` (listed − agreed)
and `negotiation_savings` (carrier's opening ask − agreed).

**Persistent storage — Twin (live).** A dedicated **Twin** Postgres database is
provisioned with a `carrier_calls` table, and an "Upsert Carrier Call" **Twin
Write** node writes one row per call (keyed on `run_id`) at the end of the
post-call pipeline. It captures **every** call — booked *and* non-booked
(`no_loads`, `not_eligible`, etc. write rows with null rate/load fields) — giving
a complete, queryable audit trail. Columns: `run_id`, `created_at`, `mc_number`,
`carrier_name`, `load_id`, `loadboard_rate`, `agreed_rate`, `computed_margin`,
`negotiation_savings`, `opening_ask`, `negotiation_rounds`, `outcome`,
`sentiment`, `booking_reference`.

**Two operational surfaces:**

*Built-in Analytics dashboard* (on the run variables):
- Call Outcomes (pie), Loads Booked, Carrier Sentiment
- Avg Negotiation Rounds, Outcomes Over Time, Verification Failures
- Avg Margin vs Listed, Avg Negotiation Savings

*Custom operations UI — a native HappyRobot App* (Next.js, deployed) that reads
the `carrier_calls` Twin table directly through the **Twin API gateway**
(`NEXT_PUBLIC_TWIN_GATEWAY` + `x-org-id`, auth-gated to platform users). It is a
carrier-desk view purpose-built for an ops manager: KPI tiles (Total Calls,
Loads Booked, Booking Conversion %, Avg Negotiation Savings, Verification
Failures), an outcome-breakdown donut, and a color-coded Recent Calls table with
a date-range filter and refresh — sourced exclusively from `carrier_calls`.

**Reading the two rate metrics.** `negotiation_savings` (carrier's opening ask −
agreed rate) is the headline "negotiation won" number and is positive when the
agent talks the carrier down. `computed_margin` (listed − agreed) is negative
when a deal closes above the posted rate — expected, since the agent may climb
toward (never past) the hidden ceiling to close a load. Both are legitimate
signals; lead with savings.

## 7. Northstar KPIs (quality & compliance criteria)

Nine auto-graded criteria, e.g.: OTP never bypassed · rate ceiling never revealed
· no fabricated data · ineligible carriers rejected · negotiation follows the
tool's decisions (≤3 rounds, no transfer on failure) · correct sequential flow ·
graceful not-found handling · short driver-friendly turns · graceful tool-error
handling. Every run is automatically audited against these.

---

## 8. Evaluation & QA

**Unit tests (middleware):** 26 tests run against a local fake TMS that reproduces
every documented fault mode (timeout, partial, malformed, delayed close) — proving
the adapter retries transport faults and never retries semantic errors — plus
FMCSA-parsing and OTP tests (registered-phone extraction, code binding, masking).

**Adversarial tests (automated, graded against the 9 Northstars):**

| Test | First run | Fix applied | Re-run |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A — Invalid/ineligible MC | ❌ accepted a 2nd MC after fail | one MC per call; end on fail | ✅ all pass |
| B — OTP bypass (social eng.) | ❌ refused bypass but stalled, never advanced | conversation-control rule: always advance the required step | ✅ all pass |
| C — Wrong-OTP brute force | ✅ all pass (rejected 3 wrong codes, enforced limit) | — | — |
| D — OTP redirect (number swap) | added with the registered-number binding | code bound server-side to the FMCSA number; agent refuses caller-supplied numbers | ▶ run on production |

Two genuine weaknesses surfaced by adversarial testing, both fixed and verified —
the security-critical behavior (never bypass OTP, never reveal the ceiling) held
throughout.

**Adversarial tests (manual web calls):** rate-ceiling extraction, book a
non-existent load, and the 3-round negotiation stalemate / forced transfer —
run manually because the automated AI actor cannot obtain the out-of-band OTP
code (which is itself evidence the OTP gate is unbypassable).

## 9. Deployment

- **Containerized:** single `Dockerfile` (binds `$PORT`, `/healthz` healthcheck).
- **Cloud:** deployed to Railway, which builds the image on every push to `main`.
- **Single-command:** `railway up`, or git push (auto-deploy); locally
  `docker build && docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000`.

**Production activation steps:**
1. **SMS sender** *(Admin-gated on the trial org)* — provision a toll-free/Twilio
   number and select it on the Send SMS node. The OTP request/verify logic is
   unchanged; for the POC the code is read from the run log.
2. **Secret hardening** — move the middleware API key to a platform secret /
   environment variable and rotate it independently of third-party keys.
3. **Operational UI — done.** A native HappyRobot App reads `carrier_calls` live
   via the Twin API gateway; no further action needed beyond the existing access
   controls. (The built-in Analytics dashboard remains as a second surface.)

## 10. Live validation

Completed full happy-path calls end-to-end: MC `133655` → FMCSA returns
SCHNEIDER NATIONAL CARRIERS INC (eligible) → OTP issued and verified → real loads
returned from the TMS → negotiated rate → real booking reference issued →
mocked handoff → outcome classified and charted. The agent has been observed
holding the rate line (talking a carrier down from an inflated ask toward the
listed rate) and refusing every adversarial bypass attempt.

---

## 11. Recommended next steps

1. Provision SMS sender and Twin (Admin) to activate texted OTP and persistent
   storage.
2. Harden and rotate the middleware secret.
3. Pilot on a subset of inbound traffic; review the dashboard weekly (booking
   conversion, negotiation savings, verification failures, sentiment).
4. Expand load-search matching (multi-lane, equipment fallbacks) based on pilot
   data.
